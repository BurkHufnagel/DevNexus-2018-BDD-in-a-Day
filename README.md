# DevNexus-2018-BDD-in-a-Day
Content for my "BDD in a Day" hands-on workshop.

## Setup and configuring software
The BDD-in-a-Day-Setup_Instructions.PDF file contains set up instructions that should help you get everything installed before the workshop. Please take some time to go through them before the workshop so we can spend our time learning BDD and not waiting for files to download.

## FAQ
There's not much in the FAQ file because there haven't been any questions yet about installing and configuring software and hopefully that will continue to be the case.

## Is something missing?
We will be doing quite a bit on Wednesday and what's here is essentially just enough to ensure your machine is ready to go. So don't worry that there's not a lot of code here.

Looking forward to seeing you on Wednesday!
